## Making coffee

Unfortunately (fortunately?) we do not have an electronic or automatic coffee maker. Instead making coffee is a 100% manual process. We fully embrace the idea that the more you suffer to make your coffee the better it will taste. If you wish to make coffee consider the following steps.

1. **Measure out the appropriate weight of coffee beans.** A scale can be found in the cupboard above the kitchen sink. The grinder also has fill lines if you just want to eyeball it.

2. **Heat water in the electric kettle.**

3. **Grind the beans.** Next to the electric kettle you will find the hand grinder. The base screws in clockwise and the lid anti-clockwise.

4. **Brew the coffee.** One cup of coffee is roughly half the bottom bulb and two cups of coffee will fill the bottom bulb.

5. **Enjoy!**

#### Useful Settings

- **1 cup** 9oz-18oz beans or between first and second fill line on the grinder
- **2 cups** 18oz-27oz beans or between second and third fill line on the grinder
- **Water temperature** 96C
- **Grinder setting** 5
