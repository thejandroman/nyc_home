## Making coffee

Unfortunaly (fortunately?) we do not have an electronic or automatic coffee maker. Instead making coffee is a 100% manual process. We fully embrace the idea that the more you suffer to make your coffee the better it will taste. If you wish to make coffee please follow these simple steps.

1. **Measure out the appropriate weight of coffee beans.** In the cupboard above the kitchen sink you will find a scale. Using the scale weigh out the amount of beans you will need. For 1 cup of coffee we use 9oz-18oz and for 2 cups we use 18oz-27oz. Contrary to the coffee pots fill level it can only make ~2 cups of coffee at a time.

2. **Heat water in the electric kettle.** We have found 96C to be a great tempurature to brew coffee.

3. **Grind the beans.** Next to the electric kettle you will find the hand grinder. The base screws in clockwise and the lid anticlockwise. We have found that 5 is the optimal setting for our coffee pot.

4. **Brew the coffee.** Place the grounds in the coffee pot's cloth filter. Pour the heated water over the grounds carefully. One cup of coffee is roughly half the bottom bulb and two cups of coffee will reach the middle of the hourglass shape.

5. **Enjoy!** Spent coffee grounds can be thrown out with the regular trash.
