    We miss you already

When checking out of the apartment, we ask you do to a few things:

- Close the blinds and windows (if you opened them)! Please make sure the windows are latched.
- Throw out any food in the fridge.
- Take out any trash from the kitchen and bathrooms.
- Run the dishwasher if there are dirty dishes. Make sure the "heated dry" setting is on.
- Leave the keys, any notes, checks, leftover subway cards, or comment cards on the entry table.
- Don't forget once you close the door you'll be locked out. Do one last sweep before you go!  Do you have all your shoes, chargers, phones, wallets, and laptops?  The doormen won't be able to give you access so make sure you've got everything.
