Grocery Bags are inside the front coat closet - feel free to use, otherwise you'll end up with a million plastic bags.

### Gristedes
Not our favorite but it has all the essentials and is only 2 blocks away.

### Fairway
This is our favorite grocery store; huge, lots of variety with great coffee, meat, and cheese selections.  It can get crowded on weekends but lines go fast.

### Trader Joe's
We don't usually shop here, but has all the TJ's normal items.  It can get crowded on weekends or after work.

### Bodegas
There are lots of bodegas around us with plenty of small staple items.   World of Beer is at the corner of 38th and 2nd and has lots of variety.

### Takeaway

If you don't want to grocery shop or leave the house, you can always order take out!  There are a variety of apps out there for food delivery but we use [Seamless](seamless.com).

Just let them know what apartment you're in when you give them the address. Give them delivery instructions to "buzz at the side door and doorman will buzz you into the elevator area". The front desk may ring you on the phone by the door letting you know food is on the way. Depending on the elevator traffic it might take a few minutes for the delivery person to show up.
