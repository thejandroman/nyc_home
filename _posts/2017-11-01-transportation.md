The standard fare is $2.75 and you can buy a metrocard in any station.  There might also be a few on our entry table, feel free to use and add money if necessary.

Also feel free to use the EasyPay MetroCard if it was left on the entry table. Unlike a regular MetroCard this card is linked to our CC and will autorefill if the balance drops below a certain threshold. The main thing to remember with this card is that it's not disposable like a regular MetroCard. If it is misplaced please let us know so we can deactivate it.
