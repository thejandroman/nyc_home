We go to [NY Health and Racquet Club](https://nyhrc.com/join-now/). They maybe able to offer temporary passes though you'll have to contact them to set-up.

There are locations throughout the city, but the closest to the apartment (and our home gym) is at 45th Street - 132 East 45th Street - (212) 986-3100.
