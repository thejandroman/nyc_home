Learn the essentials of our apartment

## Wifi

- SSID: `NSA-MobileUnit-TF9S4`
- Key: `Bambula1!2@`

## Physical Access

The names of everyone staying has been added to the doorman's
list. They may need to look you up the first few times if they don't
recognize you.

> **BEWARE**: It is possible to lock yourself out of the apartment

The keys you were provided allow access to our apartment, `25M`. Both
keys look very similar but they each open either the dead bolt or the
knob.

## Toilet Paper

Extra rolls of toilet paper can be found at the top of the linen closet.

## Elevators

The freight elevator is only accessible on weekends and outside business hours on weekdays without a reservation.

Be warned that elevator rush hour does exist in the mornings and evenings. Plan accordingly.
