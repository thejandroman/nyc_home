## Laundry Room

The laundry room is located in the basement and can be accessed either from the freight elevator (`LL` button) or via the stairwell behind the lobby. There are plenty of washers and driers and there are almost always one or two free. Keep in mind that it can get crowded on weekends.

The washers and driers require a keycard to use. We have left one on the fridge. It can be refilled in the laundry room if needed. Laundry detergent and spot cleaner can be found in our linen closet.
