    Don't be afraid to take whisks

While small, the kitchen is highly efficient, just a few things to note:

Everything can go in the dishwasher _EXCEPT_:
- Kitchen Knives
- Pots/Pans
- Cutting Boards
- Corona Glasses
- Frosted 50's Glasses.

We don't have measuring cups, we use a scale for more accuracy and space conservation, it is in the cupboard above the sink.

***

Garbage bags for trash and recycling are under the sink, all trash goes in the "_Refuse_" closet by the elevators.  Please break down all boxes and tuck them behind the recycling bins. The blue recycling bin is for paper products and the green is for all other recycling.

---

Dishwasher pods and other kitchen cleaning supplies are under the sink.  Additional cleaning products are in the linen closet near the master bedroom.

***

Feel free to use any spices or condiments, no need to replace.

---

Please don't leave any perishable food in the refrigerator as we may not be back for a few months.

***

The oven tends to set off the smoke alarm at high temps (400-450 for more than 45 mins). Consider cracking the second bedroom's window if doing extended baking.
