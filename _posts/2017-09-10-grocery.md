### Fairway
This is our favorite grocery store; huge, lots of variety with great coffee, meat, and cheese selections.  It can get crowded on weekends but lines go fast.

### Trader Joe's
We don't usually shop here, but has all the TJ's normal items.  It can get crowded on weekends or after work.

### Bodegas
There are lots of bodegas around us with plenty of small staple items.   World of Beer is at the corner of 38th and 2nd and has lots of variety.
